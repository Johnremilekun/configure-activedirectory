<h1>Microsoft Azure - Active Directory (AD)</h1>

This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />
<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)
<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>


Set up Azure resources: 

- Create a Windows Server 2022 VM named "DC-1" as the domain controller, noting the resource group and VNet.
- Create a Windows 10 VM named "Client-1" in the same resource group and VNet 

Ensure network connectivity between both VMâ€™s

- Login to "Client-1" via Remote Desktop and continuously ping the private IP address of "DC-1" using the command "ping -t <IP address>".
- On the domain controller, enable ICMPv4 in the local Windows Firewall, and check for a successful ping response from "Client-1".
- Install Active Directory
- Login to DC-1 and install Active Directory Domain Services
- Create an Admin and Normal User Account in AD
- Link the client VM to a domain and log in using the original admin account.
- Configure Remote Desktop for non-admin users on the client VM 
- create additional users, and test logging in with those newly created accounts.
